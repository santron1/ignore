            <h4>Chess Competition Certificate</h4>
            <p>In the highly competitive Inter-College Chess Competition organized by Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU), I achieved a remarkable 3rd position out of more than 50 skilled opponents. This accomplishment speaks to my strong strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities in the dynamic and challenging world of chess. Currently, my chess rating stands at 1935, reflecting my deep passion and unwavering commitment to the game. Chess is not merely a pastime; it symbolizes strategic thinking and mathematical prowess and underscores my dedication to continuous improvement, making it an integral part of my journey.</p>
